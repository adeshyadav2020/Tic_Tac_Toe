# Tic_Tac_Toe
The game is played on a 3x3 grid, with each player taking turns placing their mark on an empty space. The first player to get three of their marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins the game. If all 9 spaces are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a tie.
The game is implemented in Python using a simple object-oriented approach.
